# Hi there 👋
My friends call me Julie and would say my strenghts are empathy, openness and creativity. 

- 💻 I’m currently learning Web Development in a Bootcamp
- 🔭 I’m working in a Startup
- 📍 I’m based in Karlsruhe
- 🗺️ I love to travel & work as a **digital nomad**

My next dream destination is Australia. Do you think I will enjoy my work-life-balance here?
